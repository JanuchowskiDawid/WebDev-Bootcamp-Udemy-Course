    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">junglefowl</a> species, with attributes of wild species such
        as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term
        for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon.
        An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.</p>
    <p>Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
        Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
        (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.</p>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a hen.[11][12]
